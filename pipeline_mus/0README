TO RUN:
you need bash and R, with several packages
library(plotrix)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)

[~]./mk_foo.sh > foo.R
[~] R < foo.R --vanilla

Will make plots, pval, and aa for different groups:
foo_data.pdf, foo_pval.pdf, foo_aa.pdf

KNOWN ISSUES:
- There are a BUNCH of warnings in the vioplots, assuming that's the NAs
- The AA plots don't have p-values. why? Because I can, but not test.  Is this cheating, probably, but I don't look at them.  SO no pval==no pvalcorection.  
- I have to check the interactions to see if I corrected double counting

MAJOR NOTES:
-Optimized scripts to make them easier to change HOWEVER a person NEEDS to name the source file (src/foo.txt) how they want it to display in plot and have it with a txt extension

-BIN script is fairly hardcoded for the pvalues, I have to think of a better way to do that to avoid the issues ... but that might need some work.
